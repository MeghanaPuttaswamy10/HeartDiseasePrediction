# HeartDiseasePrediction

The dataset for this coursework was obtained from Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) which is a filtered version of the original dataset compiled by the University of California, Irvine (UCI) archive (link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/)

This dataset was produced by the author by integrating various datasets that were previously available but had never been integrated (our team did not perform the integration, it was done by the original author). This is one of the largest heart disease dataset currently available for research purposes and it combines five heart datasets with eleven features in common. The following five datasets were used to curate it:

Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data)
University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)
V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data)
Stalog (Heart) Data Set
